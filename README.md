# RennoCosta_Tort_eLIFE_2016

Source Files and Instructions for replication of the paper RennoCosta and Tort submited to eLIFE.
This repository include the model scripts used to produce the data for the paper; the simulation
scripts with the calls of the model scripts used to produce the dataset or a limited dataset, not
included on the paper, but that can be produced with little computational resources; and the 
analysis scripts used to produce the figures;  

List of files

1) model scripts


elife_script_convergence.py       : model script for the simulations of the first theta cycle

elife_script_morph.py             : model script with whole exploration of the envrionment

elife_script_morph_noise.py       : model script, similar to previous, but with different input noise values

elife_script_morph_consistency.py : model script, similar to previous, but with different input consistency values
